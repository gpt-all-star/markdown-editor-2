# MVP Specifications for a Client-Side Markdown Editor

1. The application should be built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
2. The application should allow users to input markdown text.
3. The application should display the formatted output from the markdown text in real-time.
4. The application should be a client-side application, implying that all processing should occur within the user's browser without the need for server-side processing.

**Note:** These specifications are intentionally minimal to focus on the core functionality of the application. Additional features or enhancements can be considered after the MVP has been developed and tested.
