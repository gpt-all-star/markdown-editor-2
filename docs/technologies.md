# Technology Stack for a Client-Side Markdown Editor

Based on the MVP specifications and the Technologies Guidelines, here is the list of technologies needed for the project:

## Frontend

- **HTML5**: For structuring the web pages.
- **CSS3**: For styling the web pages. We will use chakra-ui, a modern CSS Framework that provides a set of reusable, well-tested components.
- **JavaScript (ES6+)**: The main programming language for the application. We will use the latest ECMAScript standards.
- **React**: A JavaScript library for building the user interface. It allows us to create reusable UI components and handle the application state effectively.

## Libraries/Packages

- **chakra-ui**: A simple, modular and accessible component library that gives you the building blocks you need to build your React applications.
- **markdown-it**: A fast and easy to use Markdown parser and compiler. It will be used for parsing the user's input and converting it to HTML in real-time.

## Development Tools

- **Node.js and npm**: Node.js is a JavaScript runtime that allows us to run JavaScript on our server. npm is a package manager for Node.js, with hundreds of thousands of packages.
- **Create React App**: A command line tool that allows us to create new React.js projects with no build configuration.

## Deployment

- **Docker / Docker Compose**: For creating a reproducible environment that makes it easier to manage, maintain, and deploy the application.

## Version Control

- **Git**: For version control allowing us to track changes, revert to previous stages, and collaborate efficiently.
- **GitHub**: A hosting service for Git repositories. It provides a Web-based graphical interface and access control options for collaboration.
